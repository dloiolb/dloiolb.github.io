        <p> We were just playing around with this idea of banach spaces of martingales.
            We can fix some probability space and a certain filtration on that space and define a collection of martingales with respect to this that have the properties of right continuity and being finite under a certain norm that we also define.
            It's pretty straightforward to see that this is a linear space, and with a little bit of thinking we can discover that this is in fact a Banach space, kind of inherited from the isometry with the Lp space defined on the limit of the (increasing) filtration, for which we are already familiar to be a Banach space itself.
